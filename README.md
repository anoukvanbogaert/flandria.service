# React/Firebase/MUI Data Management Project

## This app was created with a boat charter company in mind, with the goal to keep track of customers, boats and services

This project contains the following:

-   Full login functionality with options for username/password or Google login and forgot pw/sign up
-   Admin view for users with a superAdmin: true field in their Firebase userdoc. These users have all the power to add, remove or edit other users/clients, boats, and services
-   Client view for customers which is in read-only format and gives them an overview of which services happened when on their boat(s)
